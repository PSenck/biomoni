The Model class has basic functionalities for an parameter estimation based on simulated data and experimental data saved in the Experiment class.

The Yeast class is derived from the Model class and contains the kinetic model for a yeast fed batch fermentation and a simulation routine.

The visualization module can visualize simulated and experimental data.
