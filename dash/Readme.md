This is a dash app that used the biomoni package, the app displays measurement data along with its simulated data generated through parameter estimation. There are three options to use the app. Either with data on Azure (option 1), with automatically generated data on your drive (option 2) or with data measured historiacally in the example_data folder. For connecting to Azure you need the connection string of your storage account. The data there has to be present as file share data, more information on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/storage-file-share-readme?view=azure-python.

What you may have to change: at the bottom of the app `dash_app.run_server` there is a Linux/Mac variant and a Windows variant. In Linux/mac you can use both variants, but for Windows you have to use the Windows Variant, debug must be False in Windows.
