# How to use the biomoni package in terms of an offline an estimation?

Just adapt the paths to the `example_data` directory on your drive and start the code. First do the jupyter `test.ipynb` file to understand the functionalities of the `biomoni` package. If you want to understand the code better, debug the `test.py` file step for step.

A short description of how the code works is always given as Readme.md files within the directoreies.

Note: 
Sometimes there is a bug when using the biomoni package. If you use Experiment objects together with model objects, the Experiments objects are sometimes not recognized as such. Errors like "Given Experiments should either be of type dict or list with Experiment objects" can occur, especially when the package is freshly installed in your environment. Just close the Programm and close your IDE and restart evrything, then the bug should be resolved.
